  InfoType.spyware: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Spyware&quot;,
    &quot;description&quot;:
        &quot;Mobile spyware is a classification of software programs that monitors and records information about an end user&#39;s actions without the end user&#39;s knowledge or permission. If the end user is aware that monitoring software has been installed, the software is not considered to be spyware. Like desktop spyware, mobile spyware is often installed unwittingly by the end user when he or she sideloads a third-party software app, visits or is redirected to a malicious website or leaves the computing device physically unattended. Once a mobile device is infected with spyware, the spy can eavesdrop on conversations held on (or near) a compromised smartphone or access data that is stored on or transmitted by the device. Bluetooth also offers a largely unsecured interface that can be exploited by those in close proximity, through techniques like Bluesnarfing. Smartphone accelerometers have been used in keyboard vibration attacks to detect what is typed on a computer with surprising accuracy when the phone was sitting on the desk near the keyboard. Controversially, governments have used mobile spyware to access the data of citizens, notably with the Smurf suite of spyware tools brought to public attention by Edward Snowden.&quot;,
    &quot;actions&quot;:
        &quot;Antivirus software that includes antispyware protection should be used to find and remove spyware. Although mobile security software exists, many users are lax about installing it. For one thing, phone security solutions use up system resources thereby slowing down other software and consuming power. Furthermore, because the effectiveness of app-based security has often been questioned, users may feel that installing security apps is pointless. To prevent spyware, users should only download software from trusted sources, read all disclosures when installing software, avoid clicking on pop-up ads and stay current with updates for operating system (OS) and application software.&quot;,

  InfoType.fakeapps: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Fake Apps&quot;,
    &quot;description&quot;:
        &quot;These are apps in mobile devices that trick users into downloading them by using legitimate companies or popular references. They may also pose as quirky and attractive apps, providing interesting services like live wallpapers or real-time spying tools. Once installed on a mobile device, fake apps can perform a variety of malicious routines. They can persistently push ads, track and report location and other sensitive information, or subscribe users to premium services without consent. These can all lead to loss of data and privacy and waste of device resources. To a cybercriminal, generating interest of the online public is easy by baiting users with apps that generate buzz in the mobile device-using world. Even from official sites, risks still abound in these app-distribution platforms, enough to prey on a trusting user.&quot;,
    &quot;actions&quot;:
        &quot;In today’s ever-evolving technology-driven society, it is easy to fall into the traps left by cybercriminals. A mobile device user has an average of 41 downloaded apps. With the demand still growing for more ways to expand one’s mobile device use, it is expected that more and more ways will be sought by cybercriminals to take advantage on this clamor for newer, more advanced apps. The biggest armor a smart mobile user can wear is to stay well-informed of the many ways a cybercriminal could take advantage of mobile device’s vulnerability. These simple steps are key in keeping your app-world safe from threats: Think before you download. Choose apps that will be useful to you. Be mindful of the download sites you go to for your apps. It is always best to go to official app stores for security. Always check for app details prior to your download. Reading on every tiny detail can aid you to weed out the fake or malicious apps. Never click on links with promises that are too good to be true. Read everything and carefully analyze permissions asked by apps you download. Always be in the know of security features installed on your mobile devices. Invest and install an effective mobile security app.&quot;,

  InfoType.keylogger: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Keylogger&quot;,
    &quot;description&quot;:
        &quot;Keystroke logging is an act of tracking and recording every keystroke entry made on a computer, often without the permission or knowledge of the user. A “keystroke” is just any interaction you make with a button on your keyboard. Keystrokes are how you “speak” to your computers. Each keystroke transmits a signal that tells your computer programs what you want them to do. Keylogger tools can either be hardware or software meant to automate the process of keystroke logging. These tools record the data sent by every keystroke into a text file to be retrieved at a later time. Some tools can record everything on your copy-cut-paste clipboard, calls, GPS data, and even microphone or camera footage. Keyloggers are a surveillance tool with legitimate uses for personal or professional IT monitoring. Some of these uses enter an ethically questionable grey area. However, other keylogger uses are explicitly criminal. Regardless of the use, keyloggers are often used without the user’s fully aware consent and keyloggers are used under the assumption that users should behave as normal.&quot;,
    &quot;actions&quot;:
        &quot;Always read your terms of service or any contracts before accepting. You should know what you’re agreeing to before you sign up. Researching user feedback on software you plan to install might provide some helpful guidance as well. Install internet security software on all your devices. Malicious keyloggers generally make their way to devices in software form. If you have a security software suite like Kaspersky Anti-Virus, you’ll have an active shield to guard against infections. Make sure your security programs are updated on the latest threats. Your security needs to have every known keylogger definition to detect them properly. Many modern products automatically update to protect against keylogger malware and other threats. Don’t leave your mobile and computer devices unsupervised. If a criminal can steal your device or even get their hands on it for a moment, that may be all they need. Hold on to your devices to help prevent keyloggers from being implanted. Keep all other device software updated. Your operating system, software products and Web browsers should all be up to date with the latest security patches. When an update is offered, be sure to download and install it as soon as possible. Do not use unfamiliar USB drives or external hard drives. Many criminals leave these devices in public places to entice you to take them and use them. Once plugged into your computer or mobile device, they can infiltrate and begin logging.&quot;

  InfoType.insecureWifi: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Insecure Wifi&quot;,
    &quot;description&quot;:
        &quot;Public Wi-Fi is available just about everywhere, from the local coffee shop to the hotels and airports you visit while traveling. Wi-Fi has made our lives a little easier, but it also poses security risks to the personal information available on our laptops and smartphones. Here is a helpful list of dos and don’ts you should follow if you plan to use public Wi-Fi.

Wi-Fi has made our lives a little easier, but it also poses security risks to the personal information available on our laptops and smartphones. Here is a helpful list of dos and don’ts you should follow if you plan to use public Wi-Fi.&quot;,
    &quot;actions&quot;:
        &quot;Do connect to secured public networks whenever possible. In the event that you’re unable to connect to a secured network, using an unsecured network would be permissible if the connection requires some sort of login or registration. Don&#39;t access personal bank accounts, or sensitive personal data, on unsecured public networks. Even secured networks can be risky. Use your best judgment if you must access these accounts on public Wi-Fi. Don&#39;t leave your laptop, tablet, or smartphone unattended in a public place. Even if you’re working on a secure Wi-Fi network, that won’t stop someone from taking your property or sneaking a peek at your device. Don&#39;t shop online when using public Wi-Fi. Sure, shopping doesn’t seem like it involves sensitive data, but making purchases online requires personal information that could include bank account and retailer login credentials. Shopping isn’t something you want to do on an unsecured Wi-Fi network. Do turn off automatic connectivity. Most smartphones, laptops, and tablets have automatic connectivity settings, which allow you to seamlessly connect from one hotspot to the next. This is a convenient feature, but it can also connect your devices to networks you ordinarily would not use. Keep these settings turned off, especially when you’re traveling to unfamiliar places. Do monitor your Bluetooth connectivity. Bluetooth in the home is an amazing feature on many smart devices. However, leaving Bluetooth on while in public places can pose a huge risk to your cybersecurity. Bluetooth connectivity allows various devices to communicate with each other, and a hacker can look for open Bluetooth signals to gain access to your devices. Keep this function on your phone and other devices locked down when you leave your home, office, or similar secured area. Do think about using a virtual private network (VPN) solution to ensure your privacy and anonymity are protected when you use public Wi-Fi. VPN services, like the new Norton Secure VPN, can encrypt all the data that you send and receive while using a public Wi-Fi hotspot, securing your information from other users of the same connection.&quot;
